# Express.js Server Setup

This project sets up an Express.js server to handle HTTP requests. Let's break down what's happening in the provided code:

## Dependencies

The server relies on several npm packages:

- `express`: A popular web application framework for Node.js.
- `cors`: Middleware for enabling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing the server to accept requests from different origins.
- `mongoose`: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for interacting with the MongoDB database.
- `dotenv`: A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `body-parser`: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.

## Server Setup

1. **Importing Dependencies**: The required npm packages and local modules are imported at the beginning of the file.

2. **Express App Initialization**: An instance of the Express application is created using `express()`.

3. **Environment Variables**: The `dotenv` package is used to load environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

4. **Middleware Configuration**: 
   - `express.json()`: Middleware to parse JSON bodies of incoming requests.
   - `cors()`: Middleware to enable CORS with default options allowing all origins.
   - `body-parser` is not explicitly used since `express.json()` does the job of parsing JSON bodies.

5. **Database Connection**: The `mongoose.connect()` method is called to establish a connection to the MongoDB database. The connection URL is retrieved from the environment variable `mongourl`.

6. **Routes Setup**: Various route handlers are registered with the Express application using `app.use()` method. These route handlers are responsible for defining endpoints for different resources like appointments, products, users, etc.

7. **Server Start**: The server is configured to listen on a specified port (default is 8000) using `app.listen()`. Once the server is started, a message is logged to the console indicating the server has started and on which port.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. **Set Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the MongoDB connection URL as `mongourl`.
4. **Start the Server**: Run `npm start` to start the server.
5. **Access Endpoints**: Once the server is running, you can access the defined endpoints using a tool like Postman or by making HTTP requests from your application.
